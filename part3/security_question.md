# Security question

I will use:

- Broken Access Control to ensure that my system correctly implements access controls. This includes making sure that customer support employees can only view and modify customer information and orders, and cannot access other parts of the system.

- Cryptographic Failures to make sure that sensitive data such as passwords and personal information are stored securely in the MySQL database using proper encryption methods with hashing.

- Injection to protect your system from injection attacks by validating and sanitizing inputs in the mobile app, web frontend, and Python backend.

- Insecure Design: Use secure design principles when developing my system. This includes using threat modeling, secure design patterns and principles, and reference architectures.

- Vulnerable and Outdated Components: Regularly update all components of my system, including Kubernetes containers, Android and iOS apps and other technologies.

- Identification and Authentication Failures: Implementing strong identification and authentication mechanisms. This includes using multi-factor authentication and ensuring password policies are robust.
